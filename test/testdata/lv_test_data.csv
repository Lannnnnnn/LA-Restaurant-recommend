It was the first place I tried a sushi burrito at and it did not disappoint. I've been here 3 other times since. The food is fresh and tasty, the staff is pretty nice and the atmosphere is super cute and relaxing. If you're in the mood for something new, try his place!!",5.0,5G0atQ4hWXa16DHheUO0fA

Golden China Chinese Cuisine,iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A,Las Vegas,"Restaurants, Chinese",DYHTKp65YEmIp6_CTsiY9g,"We were looking for a place to eat on a Saturday afternoon. We didn't want to eat at the hotel buffet or snack bar. We decided to get in the car and go up the street about a mile or so and we went into the parking lot for Smith's Grocery store. We've seen Golden China restaurant for many years. Most of the time, it was too late and they were closed. We've always said we would give it a try it.. Well today was the day and it was absolutely delicious. We ordered the special chicken wings and two lunch combos with Kung Pao combo and hot garlic chicken. Can't beat the price with the drink. About 20 bucks! The food is cooked to order, which is a plus. I don't think they use any type of MSG which is marvelous. I'm allergic to MSG anyway. They deliver the food to your table hot and fresh! They even put it in to go containers. It doesn't matter if you're eating there or taking it to go this is the way you get your food. The portions are large. Hubby and I are stuffed and happy.",5.0,H8p_O6SFWNRycSrN8NStaQ

He was sweet, but he seemed a inexperienced. They do offer military discounts! A big plus was the bathrooms were really clean!

Imperial Palace Hotel & Casino,9wjTzw8bEYOTQJk41V8WQw,Las Vegas,"Restaurants, Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Arts & Entertainment, Casinos, Event Planning & Services",-xXyxVzcYoBZ9SQMTSJnbA,"Imperial Palace is not just outdated because it's old, dingy, and still has popcorn ceilings in the guest rooms. It's outdated because it has this non-specific, non-unique, pan-Asian decor that originated long before the now-common concept of Asian fusion. In fact, Imperial Palace was re-themed in 1979, when using the term ""Oriental"" was still acceptable. I'm pretty sure nothing has changed since then, even though Asian decor now conjures up bamboo, rich greens and browns, and soft fabrics far more than it does pagodas, blocky script font, or a blue and white color scheme.  My husband and I have been inside Imperial Palace many times before to gamble, check out the celebrity impersonators/dealers (gotta love that Charro wannabe calling out roulette numbers!), and sing at the karaoke lounge (which used to be located downstairs in the little detached space in front of the main entrance and is now inside the main hotel). However, we had never stayed there, choosing instead to spend a bit extra (or on a good weekend, significantly less!) for a hotel that was a lot nicer (our favorites include Aladdin/Planet Hollywood, Bally's, and Mandalay Bay). This particular weekend, however, was Veteran's Day and also happened to be the weekend Madonna was in town for a show and the weekend of a massive bull-riding convention (always forget these kind of things exist!).  Anyway, hotels were a lot more expensive than we were used to paying in Vegas and we were only planning to be in town for the night, so we ended up choosing the Imperial Palace. I knew from the pictures on the web site that the rooms were going to be hideous, but I could never have anticipated just how dingy and unappealing they were. The walls had a yellowish tint, the furniture was peeling, and the concrete on the patio was almost black from various, un-identified stains. We were also weirded out by the sign on the patio door that said ""This door may self-lock from the outside."" What a relief that we weren't planning to spend a second out there anyway!  I agree that Imperial Palace is in a great location. I also know that most people (like my husband and I) will not spend much time in their hotel room while in Vegas. I also still think that IP is a true, character-filled kind of spot to gamble while you are out and about. However, unless you plan to be with friends (and not with a SO or spouse that you may actually want to be close to) and are truly not snobby about your accommodations (be honest with yourself, people!), you may want to spend a bit extra and actually stay elsewhere. If you do decide to take the plunge, bring some Febreeze and check your diva self at the door!",2.0,gru76BjkRY6UQVcw_yAxiQ
Port of Subs #114,rFP41LryXOyizCuMPjjw1A,Las Vegas,"Sandwiches, Restaurants",QXYu1jxa-lpRQC5L3lKarg,"It is in an airport and my wife and I ate for 22 dollars.  First, for 2 sandwiches in an airport I usually pay more so the price point is on the low end for airport pricing. My hot pastrami was not the best I have ever had.  It was hot, I could get whatever I wanted on it, and it does the job. For the fools who complain about the quality, price, or a combination of the two remember it is in Las Vegas where your hamburger joints on the strip hit you for 40 dollars for 2, this place isn't a bad deal.",3.0,ATbClROKzPaAfjnq7dT3Yg
