Golden China Chinese Cuisine,iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A,Las Vegas,"Restaurants, Chinese",DYHTKp65YEmIp6_CTsiY9g,"We were looking for a place to eat on a Saturday afternoon. We didn't want to eat at the hotel buffet or snack bar. We decided to get in the car and go up the street about a mile or so and we went into the parking lot for Smith's Grocery store. We've seen Golden China restaurant for many years. Most of the time, it was too late and they were closed. We've always said we would give it a try it.. Well today was the day and it was absolutely delicious. We ordered the special chicken wings and two lunch combos with Kung Pao combo and hot garlic chicken. Can't beat the price with the drink. About 20 bucks! The food is cooked to order, which is a plus. I don't think they use any type of MSG which is marvelous. I'm allergic to MSG anyway. They deliver the food to your table hot and fresh! They even put it in to go containers. It doesn't matter if you're eating there or taking it to go this is the way you get your food. The portions are large.

Imperial Palace Hotel & Casino,9wjTzw8bEYOTQJk41V8WQw,Las Vegas,"Restaurants, Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Arts & Entertainment, Casinos, Event Planning & Services",-xXyxVzcYoBZ9SQMTSJnbA,"Imperial Palace is not just outdated because it's old, dingy, and still has popcorn ceilings in the guest rooms. It's outdated because it has this non-specific, non-unique, pan-Asian decor that originated long before the now-common concept of Asian fusion. In fact, Imperial Palace was re-themed in 1979, when using the term ""Oriental"" was still acceptable. I'm pretty sure nothing has changed since then, even though Asian decor now conjures up bamboo, rich greens and browns, and soft fabrics far more than it does pagodas, blocky script font, or a blue and white color scheme.  My husband and I have been inside Imperial Palace many times before to gamble, check out the celebrity impersonators/dealers (gotta love that Charro wannabe calling out roulette numbers!), and sing at the karaoke lounge (which used to be located downstairs in the little detached space in front of the main entrance and is now inside the main hotel). However, we had never stayed there, choosing instead to spend a bit extra (or on a good weekend, significantly less!) for a hotel that was a lot nicer (our favorites include Aladdin/Planet Hollywood, Bally's, and Mandalay Bay). This particular weekend, however, was Veteran's Day and also happened to be the weekend Madonna was in town for a show and the weekend of a massive bull-riding convention (always forget these kind of things exist!).  Anyway, hotels were a lot more expensive than we were used to paying in Vegas and we were only planning to be in town for the night, so we ended up choosing the Imperial Palace. I knew from the pictures on the web site that the rooms were going to be hideous, but I could never have anticipated just how dingy and unappealing they were. The walls had a yellowish tint, the furniture was peeling, and the concrete on the patio was almost black from various, un-identified stains. We were also weirded out by the sign on the patio door that said ""This door may self-lock from the outside."" What a relief that we weren't planning to spend a second out there anyway!  I agree that Imperial Palace is in a great location. I also know that most people (like my husband and I) will not spend much time in their hotel room while in Vegas. I also still think that IP is a true, character-filled kind of spot to gamble while you are out and about. However, unless you plan to be with friends (and not with a SO or spouse that you may actually want to be close to) and are truly not snobby about your accommodations (be honest with yourself, people!), you may want to spend a bit extra and actually stay elsewhere. If you do decide to take the plunge, bring some Febreeze and check your diva self at the door!",2.0,gru76BjkRY6UQVcw_yAxiQ

First, for 2 sandwiches in an airport I usually pay more so the price point is on the low end for airport pricing. My hot pastrami was not the best I have ever had.  It was hot, I could get whatever I wanted on it, and it does the job.

The places we've tried prior to Brew Tea have been ok... but the bubbles have been too soft or inconsistent within my drink. Otherwise, the milk tea has a coffee-ish flavor which is... weird? I wasn't expecting coffee?  Anyways, we decided to try this place out and I'm soo glad we did! It's a little from where we live so unfortunately it's not as convenient to just go on a whim. I ordered the Okinawa Milk tea with bubbles and the BF ordered the honey dew slush with bubbles.

Food was mediocre, and my delivery was missing things that I paid extra for. Food: 2 Chicken Kabob Plate: Chicken was well seasoned, but it was unevenly cooked. Some pieces were overcooked and some pieces were actually undercooked. Beef Kabob Plate: Beware that this is actually a kefta (ground beef). It is pretty tasty though! In both plates, the rice was very, very dry and the salad tasted barely seasoned. Delivery: 1 My order was pretty messed up. I specified that I wanted tzatziki, but I got tahini. I paid for extra pita, but I never received it. The only plus side is that they somehow managed to add the right veggies to the salad as specified in my order.",1.0,scWPwwaZeZsk0OzJ856z-w

It isn't much fun being ignored by the bartender who doesn't give a hoot about his job or the guests who sit at ""his"" bar.  (He must truly believe it is his bar the way he behaves while on duty!)    Three of us must have waited 10 minutes before he would even acknowledge us because he was busy chatting at the end of the bar not two steps from us with someone who already had drinks.  He walked by us three times at a turtle slow pace and still wouldn't glance at us purposely ignoring us.  Heard him mumbling and grumbling about his patrons in a disgraceful manner.

Hobak Korean BBQ,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,Las Vegas,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Korean",KvM9PpkKtebbTCGG8oVS8w,"Vampires Safe Zone!  The garlic at this fine establishment is enough so that all Vampires will be banished from the area.  On a date, no problem dude!  The bathroom has mouthwash, toothbrush and toothpaste.  You will still be dazzling and minty fresh for your date! Second time here in a month and I must say, I am simply amazed.  Why would I, he who scarfs down food quicker than you can say ""what does Hobak mean in English"", be amazed when I eat so fast. That is just it. Normally I am eating so fast I really cannot tell the difference, but here I find that the quality of meat, the marinade, and everything is just, well, as Jungkook of BTS says, ""You are the cause of my Euphoria"".  Yes, Hobak, you are the cause of my Euphoria. 1. WAIT - Yes, if you are going to go to this place during normal eating hours, be prepared to wait.  No reservations, busy, busy and long lines. This place was built to wait. There is a tremendously large waiting area outside, with misters for the heat. They are prepared for you to wait. 2. PARTY - Just two of us?  We can make it if we try?  Well, that was a great Grover Washington song, but good luck. You are gonna have to wait like everyone else. Big party, small party, they can accommodate nearly all sizes. You just have to wait. 3.  Best time to go with no wait - 3:00 pm or 11:00 am when they open. Mondays are oddly busy and just as odd, Saturday night not as busy...  4.  Pork Belly or Big Belly - Seokjin of BTS famously says, """"Win. Lose. I don't care because at the end of the day I still have this face so who's the real winner here?"" So, no matter about the wait no matter about what you order, you are gonna love the food here and I still have a full big belly full of Korean BBQ, so who's the real winner here?  By the way, the Pork Belly is amazing!  5.  Service - Top notch, friendly, they will cook for you and for other tables. They don't miss a beat and they will help you order and help you figure out what to eat with what if you are not on your A game with what to dip in what. 6.  The food - I went for the large Family Combo 1 large because No. 2 son was in town and celebrating his birthday. He works out like crazy and has high metabolism, so he hadn't eaten all day.  This came with Brisket, Pork Belly, Short Ribs and Aged Pork Ribs.  Also ordered the Angus Beef Honey Tartare and some Cold Noodles to polish this off. This was enough for like 6 people and the three of us had plenty to take home. 7.  AYCE - No way. This is not AYCE and frankly, it was much better anyway and plenty of food. 8.  Sugar, oh Honey Honey - While this was a great sone by the Archies, Did you miss my point on the Angus Beef Honey tartare in point 6 above?  This is my sole reason for coming here. Steak Tartare. Raw beef simply seasoned is one of the most amazing dishes that I love to love and here, at Hobak, was the first time I have tried this in a Korean restaurant. No, I wasn't crying. I had allergies.  The Angus Beef Honey tartare is a must if you like it raw. 9.  Speaking of Sugar - if you order the family combo, you get your choice of desert. What else can I say, this place I really like. they are open from 11-11, and pick your time wisely.  Great place to come and enjoy.  When you are done,  don't be shy.  Order desert! We went for the Rice Pop Ice Cream.   They only give you two order with the large family combo, but it was like 8 pieces.  Huge slices of ice cream in a Rice Pop sandwich.  Yep, Almost just like Clemenza said to Rocco in the Godfather, ""leave the meat, take the Rice Pop Ice Cream.""  You are gonna love it. GK says, check this place out.",5.0,owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g

I went and brought the 3 course meal . Spend $35 dollars,  was asked what kind of tortillas I said corn please. They forgot the corn tortillas. I asked for extra avocado on the salad which I got charged for they said they would put it separate, they didn't!!! They also put maybe like five tiny pieces of chicken in the salad looks nothing like the picture. The actual salad looked like it was half empty. And the avocado was brown with a bunch of seasoning on top of it to cover it up. I would honestly take a picture of it but its kind looks disgusting. The chicken was fine. What's funny is that since I had asked for extra things I actually tipped the guy that was the server in the window. But it's fine I will be driving the extra mile to the Charleston location .You would think that a new chain restaurant that just opened up would want to make sure that they are serving the freshest best looking products to make sure that they can build a customer base.

The Pernil was a tad bit on the salty/greasy side, and the gandules in the rice were a little hard. I've had softer Pasteles, and SR's version is kinda dense, but okay...personal preference I guess...maybe I'll give it another try later, but for now, it's just shy of being a fan. ALOHA!!!

I wanted to speak with a manager to inquire about a charge on my credit card, and she just said 'manager not here' and hung up on me. I called back to find out when the manager or if anyone could help me and she yelled like my mother would yell at me asking how I know about the restaurant and how could I have been charged if I haven't been there. What? I just told her I ate there a few days ago. Anyway she yelled again that she is busy and hung up on me again.  They were super friendly taking my money but when there is an issue they certainly don't care.  I ate here twice. Both times the black bean noodles were way too greasy (was trying to give it another try).  The champon seafood noodle soup was ok but just because you throw in a bunch of seafood it doesn't impress me if it isn't quality.  The kimchi fried rice was ridiculously salty so I just took it home and mixed white rice with it.  I think the great reviews exist due to personal taste, and Hawaiian style food is usually cultural not something most people like.  It's not like Italian or sushi where quality is a must, because from reading some reviews about this Island restaurant, quality is not a standard...cockroaches and dirty diapers?

While I had been to this Whole Foods sans baby twice before to buy snacks, drinks, and ready-to-eat food (which tastes better here than at other Whole Foods in the SF Bay Area).. I had never actually bought produce nor toiletries. For my daughter, I bought air-chilled chicken liver (which I prepared 4x a week at home for my daughter due to her iron deficiency), organic cage-free brown eggs, shredded cheese, organic butter, and organic fruits (blueberries, grapes, satsumas). The satsumas were the most juicy and delicious I had ever tasted and everything else was a hit. Except for the air-chilled chicken liver, which I cooked the same day but emitted such a foul smell when I cooked it that all of us gagged and retched. It was completely inedible.

Now the sound of screeching tires...   a wild left turn from the right lane and we were there...    at Joyful House. Once we thanked the gods that we were still alive...  we checked the yelp reviews...      a lot of them... and a really good average.  Alright, looking forward to this.

Come HUNGRY Out comes tea...     that's cool...   then a very large bowl of soup...Sooooo tasty.    Next egg rolls, dumplings, and other assorted fried goodies.....     MMmmmmmmm Ok now rice.

They had some bottled seasoning called magic dust that added some flavor but I liked it better on the potatoe salad my fiance had than on the meat. Side portions were alittle small but the meat portion was ample. It came with a dinner roll and extra cornbread muffins were .49 cents. I would have liked if the muffins came with all the meals standard. or give an option for roll or muffin. All in all it was good but not great. Maybe next time I will try baby back ribs...It was just ok...not finger licking outstanding. We shareda  slice of pecan pie.

They are know for their ""Dirty"" bacon-wrapped hot dogs with all types of delicious toppings. Today I had the Pastrami dog on a lobster roll and elote fries, SO GOOD! There so much flavor- I've never had anything like it. Same with the elote fries, the fries are fried perfectly and they don't get soggy, crunchy outside with a soft inside. It looks really cool, there's a map of Vegas on one wall and you put a flag marker on your neighborhood. There's also a a hot sauce wall with about 50 different kinds. The playlist is always good- old skool hip-hop. Great vibe!",5.0,_eDBoMkCv0KRtMWd7xNrBg
Windy City Beefs N Pizza,dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g,Las Vegas,"Restaurants, Pizza, Hot Dogs",exsOWbxs9JM3NSB5TO_Paw,"FYI Grand Opening is today & all dine-in orders are 50% off 1/25/13 til 10pm! Why are you still reading this, go there now! This is an update for a multi meetup event on 1/17/13. If you look at the pics I posted (the ones with the signs that say what each pizza is) you will see an amazing variety of pies.  The owners Tim and Dakota were very accommodating, they met with our organizers a week prior to discuss the setup and what we expected. Even though they do not have salads on their menu, they went out of their way to provide us with a large tossed salad so we could have it served with our pizzas. Our group had it set up as ""communal style"" so we can try several different pizzas and there is something for everyone. Tim and Dakota set up some tables near the front and set it up buffet style, and brought out a couple different pizzas every 15 or 20 minutes so that the food was hot during the event.  They had plenty of tables set up for our group of 32+ people, and there was plenty of room to move around and socialize. Their waitstaff was attentive and came over several times during the course of our event to check on us. We went to the counter to order our own beverages. They also allowed us to bring in beer and wine since their liquor license is not in yet.  Everyone in the group was happy and it was a very fun time, nice atmosphere. Nice flat screens are on the walls and the room is brightly lit. Very positive feedback from all, I did not hear one complaint which is huge (because there is always one in every crowd).  Here is what we ordered: Thin Crust:  Ultimate Veggie (green pepper, onion, mushroom and tomatoes)  Sausage Classic (sausage, green pepper, mushroom, onion)  White Pizza (olive oil, ricotta, garlic, tomatoes)  Cheese  Pepperoni/Bacon  Pepperoni Deep Dish:  Cheese [note: this was REALLY GOOD!!! Cooked perfectly, gooey cheese, delicious sauce, oh my!!!] Sausage/Onion  Meat Special (Sausage, Pepperoni, Ground Beef & Bacon)  WCBPN Loaded (Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Onions, Green Peppers & Black Olives)  Ground Beef/Mushroom FYI they don't have the NBA or Ice package but when your sports games are on regular TV this is a great place to watch some sports. I will be back with a group to watch the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks games because it IS ""Windy City pizza!""",5.0,TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ

Interior decor and vibe reminds me of NY for sure.  Small, somewhat cramped seating.  Barely room to put all your food on the table. Let's get to the best part, I had the ribeye and it was absolutely delicious.  The glaze on that bad boy made it so delectable.  Size was big, cooked perfectly!! Apps were just ok, nothing that really stood out to me.  Had the clam chowder, bruschetta and caprese salad. Service was wonderful, every waiter we had was on top of what they were responsible for. We came for our anniversary and they certainly did their best to make us feel special :) Sad, we'd venture into fancier restaurants wouldnt get the same service, so it was definitely appreciated here! I'll definitely be back!!",4.0,F_WfNGoYHAHDQy2abIYoNg

Unlike most ayce Korean BBQ, you directly get the food to grill yourself and they have a wide variety. Kalbi is only at dinner.  They have a small salad bar, about 8 meats, a sushi bar, some Chinese dishes, and some Korean side dishes. The place is very clean and their ventilation system ensures its not smoky inside.

The Venetian is DEFINATELY OVER RATED. For the price of a suite I had HIGH expectations, especially from the reviews here. Anyways, the casino itself is nice. Love the design and the paintings on the celings. As far as the hotel goes..I open the door and I say to myself ""UH this is it?"" Anyway, the Bathroom was small, the tub had no jets, and it was just very disappointing. Not to mention housekeeping forgot to provide us with Robes. And the iron there was OLD and leaking water/broken. The sheets were't that comfortable, although the bed was alright. To call the front desk I had to wait for like 15 minutes. Anyway, I stayed at THE HOTEL @ Mandalay last year and it definately was WAAAY Better than THE VENETIAN and it was about the same price if you find a deal. What else was I not satisfied with this place? Their dresser/cabinets was not adequate to put clothes in at all so I had to live out of my luggage which I HATE. I want to take out my clothes and have somewhere to put them like a DRAWER. There were not enough hangers. The hallways are pretty narrow. It was definatley NOT worth the amount of money I spent here. Anyway, I would not go here again. I would probably go back to THE HOTEL or try Bellagio. Was disappointed with the Venetian =(",3.0,Y44bfyjwLv0ievYdwo-BiA

Whole Foods Market,QdXg79fKbFLEPePPnL02Fw,Las Vegas,"Health Markets, Restaurants, Specialty Food, Grocery, Food, Organic Stores",NQyoAxEJpUMhvPKV3Dvabw,"I tend to avoid Whole Foods as a rule of thumb due to the high sense of entitlement exhibited by both customer and employee alike. However, when I do stop by, I'm relegated to the fact that I will grossly overpay for their products. At least the quality of their products is pretty consistent and good. My last trip was the absolute worst. I went in because a friend wanted to use the restroom and decided to get an Arnold Palmer (for those who don't know, it's iced tea & lemonade). Upon checkout, the cashier said it was over $6! I said it can't be right and that her screen reads ""smoothie"" but she said ""I already rang it in and the other counter wrote the code."" I asked if she thought $6 was a bit excessive for tea and lemonade and she replied, ""no. If you have a problem, you can go back to the other counter, but you still have to pay for this (the drink).""  I reluctantly paid and asked for a receipt and she could not provide one. So, both incompetence and rudeness. I now begin my complete ban of all Whole Foods stores. Way to not care!",2.0,BGFyfAOQm_Euanxggz-Y7Q
