If you download their app you get rewards for a free pretzel. 

I love the Wetzel's bites either salty or cinnamon. The Wetzel's dog bites are okay, they taste like hot dogs.",5.0,7C4B2Skmh4X9f8xJDo9O4w

IwB5Ymk2lbuyeXUMBNgppw,9O-L6F0cMfNmE5i07pN_xQ,Driving around wanting something sweet and do it locally. We've been here once before and very happy with the pies and service and so we came back. Once again DELISH!! We had the chocolate cream pie and the banana cream pie and we ate ALL of it. One day I'll catch the cherry pie but these were very tasty.,5.0,Q6OjHSEwO55rGLo0Wczoug
iNKkGqIDj3ZDpYuWuyT5VA,wERcL1KznuTgfltSKQt_jg,"Great food, people and location, the managers, Scott specifically always go out of their way to get NASCAR on at least one TV. Not many sports bars go out of their way to keep customers happy, like Zipps.

Update: Still decent but could be better, doesn't seem like they want to make the atmosphere better. It's a pain to get a specific game on outside and to get volume is a real pain in the arse. Love the location but they could really make it better.

Dysfunctional! Hard to get games outside, service isn't very good, the 40 st location is way better, our group is taking our business elsewhere, a shame to because the location is great. They need to get better management.",1.0,FsNBiid47SkFaWdhl7ciYQ
WUAt5-krh075Ie44np8Hew,fnZrZlqW1Z8iWgTVDfv_MA,"So why would I be giving a Fast Food chain location a 5 star rating? For some reason, THIS Carl's Jr. is one in a million. Yes, there is an In-and-Out across the street but this Carl's Jr is everything In-and-Out can't be. 

First of all, THEIR SHAKES!!! Carl's Jr. shakes are hand scooped, and mixed upon order unlike they're competitors across the street. The chocolate shake IS the best I've EVER had from a drive thru. Point for Carl's Jr.

Second, the hand battered chicken strips were literally hand battered, i watch the guy through the service window dip and fry. The single best chicken strips i've ever had (but they may need new sauces, tired of BBQ...but still outstanding nonetheless). Point 2 for Carl's Jr

Lastly, Hours. 24/7 on the weekends and midnight on the weekdays. Brilliant for my late night guru-ness.

Worth the drive!",5.0,YDkC5VVT8s9NlIZtAr8NUA
t2BfvzrTf9gQZFW-lxQF4w,e1ZqkqjLsUCo4vIBLzaTDA,Fun place for kids of all ages. Lots of seating for parents to sit and watch. The price is a little bit cheaper than other similar jumping places. The down fall is the loud music blasting over poor speakers.,3.0,4cZD-pAOFt1k3VdTzW5R5Q
NGlySly0esPOv7mv6GEFCA,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"My follow up visit to Michael Mina came after a conversation with the Manager at the restaurant. Customer service is key and he was keen on understanding what went wrong on the first visit so he could correct the situation. The second time around it was how I had hoped the first time. Service was just absolutely excellent; each member of the staff was professional and detailed in explaining the menu items along with the selected wines. The presentation was as good as the food tasted. My girlfriend took on the seafood dishes while I handled the meat dishes. Each was just exquisite in their preparation and taste while cooked to our liking accurately. Service on the table was prompt and not over bearing. The deserts were just flavor packed; even the small chocolate chip cookie that was served with the root beer was warm out of the oven. The passion fruit desert was like biting into a delicious fresh passion fruit. 

I have to say Manager and the restaurant has earned a third visit from me and I will look forward to that day.",5.0,YIjln3huUyq29CDPBSjLdQ
IPmLMdfnIinV8taE1MonBw,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"Love this place !!!  Marlene and Joe are the greatest !!!  Back when TWA was still flying we and a bunch of other airline/airport employees would go here. Now we make it a point to stop there on race weekends. Great food, great portions, great atmosphere and great prices.  The Tri - color three cheese tortellini will make you slap someone !!!",5.0,ZEpS0eOpUeqk0FrnD1njEg
iwztwwy0WILE4DXgDHuH_g,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"This place is always amazing both in house or via take out.  

My all time favorite is the oyster mushrooms with lemongrass sauce.  
Other great menu options - drunken noodles, corn soup, fried fish, spring rolls, and the list goes on.

There's a great atmosphere here and the service is always amazing.  The waitresses are top of the line.  Always so professional and accomodating.  And yes, they will upsell you on dessert ;)",5.0,bNDNAnynGFLqDsJhSO_U1w
