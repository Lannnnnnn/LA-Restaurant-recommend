I got in the drive through and I was told to wait. I watched the cars at In N Out moving, and there I was, waiting to place an <phrase>order</phrase>. Finally, I decided to go across the street, where a <phrase>young girl</phrase> was outside <phrase>taking orders</phrase>, and these idiots never returned to the <phrase>speaker</phrase>. So I drove <phrase>forward</phrase>, to get out, there was ONE <phrase>car</phrase> (not 100) in front of the window. Luckily I was able to back out, as there was no one behind me.

I definitely choose their <phrase>chicken</phrase> <phrase>sandwich</phrase> over any other <phrase>fast food</phrase> place in <phrase>town</phrase> that is. The <phrase>chicken</phrase> isn\\'t breaded and its always tasty and moist. Their <phrase>customer service</phrase> could be a <phrase>bit</phrase> better though but it doesn\\'t stop me from coming back.\\n.\\n<phrase>Customer service</phrase> has been top notch on every visit. Their <phrase>food</phrase> is consistent and I only get two things here (not including my drink) which is the <phrase>spicy chicken sandwich</phrase> and <phrase>criscut fries</phrase>. They\\'re my <phrase>classics</phrase> :)\\n.\\nI have been eating at <phrase>carls jr</phrase> for 30 years. Their restraints have always been good or bad, meaning you know which ones to eat at and which ones to avoid. This place was one of the good ones but appears to be making the move from good to bad. Yesterday, the <phrase>food</phrase> was horrible and incorrectly made, the <phrase>restaurant</phrase> and the bathroom were both dirty, and the service was not good. It was as if the <phrase>manager</phrase> was AWOL and the workers did not care about their jobs enough to step up and run the place correctly. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever return to this <phrase>carls jr</phrase>. Looks like we are going to have to find another one.\\n.\\nHorrible!!! I haven\\'t been here in ages and now I know why! I ordered the <phrase>chicken</phrase> <phrase>sandwich</phrase> and I can\\'t even describe what the <phrase>meat</phrase> was. I took a bite into it and it had the weirdest texture. At first I thought it was a <phrase>tomato</phrase> but then I realized it was the <phrase>chicken</phrase>. It had some sort of rubbery <phrase>skin</phrase> looking thing on the <phrase>chicken</phrase>. GROSS all around!\\n.\\nYou\\'d think with In N Out across the street, they\\'d try harder! I got in the drive through and I was told to wait. I watched the cars at In N Out moving, and there I was, waiting to place an <phrase>order</phrase>. Finally, I decided to go across the street, where a <phrase>young girl</phrase> was outside <phrase>taking orders</phrase>, and these idiots never returned to the <phrase>speaker</phrase>. So I drove <phrase>forward</phrase>, to get out, there was ONE <phrase>car</phrase> (not 100) in front of the window. Luckily I was able to back out, as there was no one behind me. The ONLY reason I ever go to them is when I\\'m in a hurry and don\\'t want to wait at In N Out. Now I won\\'t even try them then!\\n.\\nYou would think that since this <phrase>Carl\\'s Jr</phrase>. is next to a new <phrase>In N Out Burger</phrase>, that this place wouldn\\'t stand a chance.\\n\\nI thought so first at too, but let me tell you -- <phrase>Carl\\'s</phrase> Jr\\'s <phrase>variety</phrase> in their menu sets them apart .\\n\\nTheir <phrase>chicken</phrase> <phrase>sandwiches</phrase> are hard to contend against.  My all time favorite (because of <phrase>taste</phrase> and healthiness) is the <phrase>Teriyaki</phrase> <phrase>Chicken</phrase> <phrase>Sandwich</phrase>!\\n\\nOnly 510 <phrase>Calories</phrase>, 17g per <phrase>sandwich</phrase>.\\n\\nCombined with the <phrase>Light</phrase> <phrase>Minute Maid</phrase> <phrase>Lemonade</phrase> it is an awesome and <phrase>low calorie</phrase> meal. \\n\\nThe shakes are also top notch!\\n\\n<phrase>Food</phrase> is a 9/10.\\n\\nService is <phrase>a 10</phrase>/10.\\n\\nCleanliness is <phrase>a 10</phrase>/10.\\n\\nThis is going on the work <phrase>lunch rotation</phrase> list!\\n.\\nSo why would I be giving a <phrase>Fast Food chain</phrase> location a 5 <phrase>star</phrase> rating? For some reason, THIS <phrase>Carl\\'s Jr</phrase>. is one in a million. Yes, there is an In-and-Out across the street but this <phrase>Carl\\'s Jr</phrase> is everything In-and-Out can\\'t be. \\n\\nFirst of all, THEIR SHAKES!!! <phrase>Carl\\'s Jr</phrase>. shakes are <phrase>hand scooped</phrase>, and mixed upon <phrase>order</phrase> unlike they\\'re competitors across the street. The <phrase>chocolate</phrase> shake IS the best I\\'ve EVER had from a <phrase>drive thru</phrase>. Point for <phrase>Carl\\'s Jr</phrase>.\\n\\nSecond, the <phrase>hand battered</phrase> <phrase>chicken</phrase> <phrase>strips</phrase> were literally <phrase>hand battered</phrase>, i <phrase>watch</phrase> the guy through the service window dip and fry. The <phrase>single</phrase> best <phrase>chicken</phrase> <phrase>strips</phrase> i\\'ve ever had (but they may need new <phrase>sauces</phrase>, tired of BBQ...but still outstanding nonetheless). Point 2 for <phrase>Carl\\'s Jr</phrase>\\n\\nLastly, Hours. 24/7 on the weekends and midnight on the weekdays. Brilliant for my <phrase>late night</phrase> <phrase>guru</phrase>-ness.\\n\\nWorth the drive!\\n.\\nI come here bout 3x\\'s a mo. & I just can\\'t do it anymore. The cook that works on <phrase>late shift</phrase> SUCKS. The <phrase>manager</phrase> is sweet. I always get <phrase>chicken</phrase> <phrase>Santa Fe</phrase> & I have to request <phrase>fresh lettuce</phrase>. The <phrase>chicken</phrase> is <phrase>rubber</phrase>, the <phrase>bread</phrase> hard on the outside. Tonight I received it the same way however my <phrase>cheese</phrase> wasn\\'t even melted. \\nIM DONE!  I go after work arrive always bout 1130pm. I\\'m sooooo DONE!!! Let me know when u get a new night cook! \\nYes I do know <phrase>food</phrase> I\\'ve been in the <phrase>industry</phrase> 15 yrs.\\n.\\n<phrase>WORST experience</phrase> EVER!!!!! never have i ate anywhere to the level of grossness this place offered. They actually served me garbage for <phrase>food</phrase>. I ordered a <phrase>chicken</phrase> <phrase>sandwich</phrase> i got to work took the <phrase>bun</phrase> off put some <phrase>ketchup</phrase> then took a bite of my burger it was so stale and hard i immediately spit it out. So after being in shock of what just happened i took the <phrase>bun</phrase> off once again and saw some of my <phrase>lettuce</phrase> was <phrase>black</phrase>. And the worst part it that the <phrase>chicken</phrase> patty was grey with some spots of <phrase>meat</phrase> missing inside its really hard to explain when i called the <phrase>manager</phrase> she really was not too concerned with the quality offered me to <phrase>remake</phrase> the burger . I couldn\\'t <phrase>possibly eat</phrase> at that location again. She then offered me a <phrase>free</phrase> burger coupon i had to go and pick it up at the <phrase>carls jr</phrase>. So when i got there i went inside for my refund and it was not the best looking inside either all the employees seemed to not even care that they served me that and they gave me a small <phrase>fountain</phrase> cup while i waited and the soda was flat. I then realized the problem is with <phrase>management</phrase> and not running that location right.  Lack of employee quality.   you can even see how  stiff the <phrase>chicken</phrase> looks on the pictures i took.\\n.\\n<phrase>Hot fresh</phrase> <phrase>food</phrase> usually.  Staff seems to turn over lots.  Bad place to put them right across from in n out, but when in n out is busy this is a good <phrase>alternative</phrase>.  Don\\'t try the new <phrase>Texas</phrase> burger, get the <phrase>Memphis</phrase> instead(much better deal). The <phrase>jalape√±o</phrase> straws are worthless!  No <phrase>spice</phrase> and <phrase>taste</phrase> stale.  Burger isn\\'t bad once you take them off, but then again it\\'s pretty much a <phrase>Memphis</phrase> with less \"<phrase>brisket</phrase>.\"\\n.\\n<phrase>Beer battered cod</phrase> <phrase>fish</phrase> seems really rubbery. It\\'s not crispy at all and the batter is really thick. Bleh.\\n.\\n<phrase>Great burgers</phrase>, <phrase>chicken</phrase> <phrase>sandwiches</phrase>, <phrase>salads</phrase>, and <phrase>breakfast items</phrase>.

       "array(['Update: After I left my initial review on Lee\\'s BBQ members from the marketing reached out to me and wanted me to give the restaurant another chance. They were very apologetic that my experience wasn\\'t a pleasant one, and explained that they were making improvements. I was actually very pleased that they reached out to to me though that was very professional. And I agreed to come back. Last night at the spur of the moment my husband decided he wanted to go back and give it s try. I contacted the marketing team through Yelp and let them know. Ben was who I was in touch with, and he promptly called the restaurant to let them know about my experience\\nFrom last time. \\n   Immediately I noticed the tone of the restaurant was different, they had control of the floor and all customers looked happy and well taken care of by the servers. Also I want to add that there was enough servers for the busy crowd. We went in at about 8pm last night (Sunday) and the restaurant was slammed, every single table was taken. And there was also many large parties. The servers were attentive and food food was served fast, our salad and side dishes were on the table before Ben even called the restaurant on our behalf. And the grill was changed half way into our meal; which was a contention I had with our last visit. The grill wasn\\'t touched at all. The drinks were refilled promptly and our meat kept coming, there was no limit on how much we could order at a time like there was last time. Our server Jenny, who was incredible by the way; noticed my daughter had hurt her finger when she touched the octopus too early right after we took it off the grill. She kindly got an ice cube and put it on her finger for her and calmed My daughter down. \\n   As a whole we really enjoyed this visit, but not only that it looked everyone else was really enjoying their time as well. And they were operating at full Capacity on a busy weekend night. I\\'ve changed my railing from a 1 Star to a 5 Star, to see original review scroll down. I do recommend this place now, and it\\'s very convenient since it\\'s located right next door to Greenland, the Korean Market. My family usually likes to eat at Lee\\'s BBQ and then go load up on Korean groceries for the house! Thanks again to Ben and the team at Lee\\'s BBQ it was a great experience last night! \\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nOriginal Review:\\nHorrible service, understaffed during dinner rush on a Sunday night. This is GO-TIME for restaurants in the Vegas Valley, the fact that the management can\\'t have the foresight to FULLY staff their restaurant during the busiest time of the day and week is absurd. There was two servers on the floor, with a full house! Customers were desperately trying to get basic things for their tables, getting refills, or just ordering more meat. Which it\\'s important to mention that you can only order 3 orders of meat at a time. I understand they do they do this in order\\nTo not waste food, but if they can\\'t even get to the tables in time to keep the food coming, then what\\'s the point?! When customers would try to get the attention of the one of the two hostess, they would say \"I\\'m not a server\" even though they can clearly see the floor is slammed. \\n  And to put a cherry on top of the shit show that has been our experience, we were getting substandard service compared to the other \"more\" Korean quests. I\\'m half Korean, and my husband and his family are Thai. We are here with my daughter, and it\\'s clear that the other guests who are Korean were getting the best service possible in this disaster. \\n  Like another reviewer said, there\\'s so many other Korean BBQ establishments available in the area. Even some in the outer perimeter of the Valley. Even though the BBQ meat was a good, we got no help from the staff, which is customary at Korean BBQ joints. My bibim naengmyeon was not good at all, with no variety of crunchy veggies to go with it, which is customary. Also, there was no grill change in the middle of our meal, and by the end we were cooking on a grill that was very crusty and not heating the meat evenly, with a lot less surface available to cook at all. \\n   I\\'d recommend Sura Korean BBQ, which in the same area. Or Moo Woo Korean BBQ which is in Centennial. The staff at those locations are actually happy to be working and offer exemplary customer service each time. With food that is always consistent. We are extremely patient when we go out to eat, and this experience has completely pushed us to our limits. Never coming back. DON\\'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!',\n",
       "       \"Always great service and Mr. Lee and his team always takes care of us when we have a large party. They go above and beyond in their service (we brought in a cake and they put candles and a nice display for the cake without asking). The food here is great, especially the brisket and bulgogi, and the place is very clean. You also get a free drink when you check in with Yelp so that's a plus!\"],\n",
