## Important Things:
* This repository contains the files needed in order to view our project website locally.
* The website represents the 'Visual Presentation' portion of our project, but also serves as our main project output, which is a dynamic website.
* This website runs using Flask as a development server when working locally.
* This website can also be found publically at http://vil069.pythonanywhere.com/

## How to run website locally:
* First, git clone this branch using the command 'git clone --branch website https://github.com/catherinehou99/yelp-recommender-system.git'
* Afterwards, wherever you have decided to git clone this branch to, enter the 'yelp-recommender-system' directory
* Once in the directory and you are on the same level as files such as app.py and test.py, enter 'flask run' in the terminal
* Flask will notify in the terminal that it has begun running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Going to this url on a browser will display the website.
